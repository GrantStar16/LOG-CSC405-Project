The Rules of Set (courtesy of Wikipedia):
1. Certain combinations of three cards are said to make up a set
2. Cards must either display the exact same characteristic or completely different characteristics
3. The four categories of characteristics are: shape (diamond, square, circle), shading (solid, cross-hatched, empty/white), color (red, green, blue), and number.

The game consists of a hard mode (where all cards shuffle every 15 seconds and the screen displays new cards) and an easy mode (no changing cards on the screen).
The game will end when all sets of cards have been found, and it displays the amount of points you've earned.
You select cards by clicking on them, the screen displays an output message letting you know if any three cards you've selected is a set or not.
